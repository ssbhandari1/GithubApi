# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




(1.) In this project i have use fakejson because the Github job api doesnt work in my browser ,If i have api so its easy to access data and and store data in redux;




(2.) But the All functionality are same so First i call the data in home page not all data but only 50 job show in home page 


(3) and I have use For searching the job mui search so if you search any job in search box and click the search icon so the all related job are show in home page 

(4)
First of all you can register and your data is stored in localstorage and when you sign in so the localstorage data match to you filled data if the data match you can log in other wise not

(5)
and also you can view details of the each job and then you can apply the job and fill the form and The form have some input field 

(6)
if You fill the data in form so you can submit and you application successfully submit and in the last you can see the preview page to show your data you have filled in form and the job information also

(8)
SO this is the all about of this project
